# Automated Portfolio

This project contains the codebase for my personal portfolio website. The projects displayed on the site are automatically updated through a CI/CD pipeline that retrieves repository data directly from the GitHub API, ensuring the portfolio always reflects my latest featured work.

## Tech stack

1. Next.js for the frontend

2. GitHub actions for the CI/CD pipeline

3. Vercel for hosting

4. GitHub REST API as data source
